# Introduction

Welcome to the official website of the symbol.equation.gpt R package. This package provides a powerful user interface that can be launched on the Viewer pane or in a Modal pane within the RStudio environment.

There are a number of cool functionalities within this package that allows one to insert more than 1000 symbols or greek letters or arrows and so on into an Rmarkdown or Shiny application. 

Aside from this, there is an equation tab that allows the user to build an equation. This panel allows the user to download the equation and user it within the document. The equation may also be directly converted to LaTeX and used within either an Rmarkdown or Shiny application.
